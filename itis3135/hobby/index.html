                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>For me, music is more than a hobbyâ€”it's a spiritual journey. I delve into every
                    element of a song, feeling the pulse of each instrument and unraveling the
                    emotions it evokes. It's like meditation, connecting me to memories and 
                    feelings in a way that's hard to articulate. It's a deeply personal experience
                    that transcends words, but it's a connection that enriches my life beyond measure. </p>

                <h2>What</h2>
                <p>"Dreamy daze" feels like a cozy cloud of sound, gently carrying me away to a world 
                    where time loses its grip and worries fade into the background. It's like drifting 
                    through a hazy daydream, where each note is a whisper from the universe, stirring up 
                    emotions and memories I didn't even know I had. It's not just about hearing the music; 
                    it's about feeling it wash over me like a warm embrace, melting away the stresses of 
                    the day and inviting me to get lost in its enchanting embrace.</p>
